## To Dos:

* Modify markdown to use gatsby-image for images
* Modify markdown to use gatsby-link for links
* Create a "View Source" link in the post footer that links to the markdown file on github
* Create configurable "templates" in the frontmatter so different pages can have their own look and feel
    * Maybe a variable for "table of contents" that when enabled displays a table of contents with anchor links to each heading
        * must research a markdown processor for this
